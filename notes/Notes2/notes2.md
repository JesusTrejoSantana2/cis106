# Notes 2

## 1. What is an Operating System?
An operating system provides all fundamental software features of a computer. An OS enables you to use the computers hardware providing you the basic tools that make the computer useful. All of those features relay on the OS's kernel. Other OS features are owed to additional programs that run atop the kernel. 

## 2. What is a kernel?
An OS kernel is a software component that's responsible for managing low-level features of the computer, including the following managing system hardware, memory allocation, CPU time, and program to program interaction. 

## 3. Which other parts aside from the kernel identify an OS?

Command-Line Shells 
* This was the de facto way of using computers before the Graphical Interface was invented. CMDs work by typing commands in a shell. In Linux, the entire system can be control via the CLI. 

Graphical User Interfaces 
* GUls rely on icons, menus, and a mouse pointer for the user interaction. Linux relies on a GUI known as the X Window System in combination with desktop environment program suites. 

Utility and Productivity Programs 
* Tools like web browsers, document processors and text editors. 

Libraries 
* Libraries are collections of programming functions that can be used by a variety of programs. 

## 4. What is linux and linux distribution?

Linux is a Unix-like Operating System popular in academic and business environments. 

Linux distributions (any operating system that runs the Linux kernel) 

## 5. List at least 4 linux characteristics:

* Linux is open source software 

* Linux is available free of charge. 

* The vast majority of server applications on the internet run on some version of Linux 

* You can install Linux on almost any system as it supports almost every processor architecture 

## 6. What is Debian?

Debian is an all-volunteer organization dedicated to developing free software and promoting the ideals of the Free Software community. 

## 7. List and define the different types of licensing agreements

* Open Source: the software may be distributed for a fee or free. The source code is distributed with the software. 

* Closed Source: the software is not distributed with the source code. The user is restricted from modifying the code. 

* Freeware: the software is free but the source code is not available. 

* Shareware: the software is free on a trial basis. 

* Free software: the software is distributed with the source code. The software can be free of charge or obtained by a fee. 

## 8.  What is Free Software? Define the 4 freedoms.

Free software: the software is distributed with the source code. The software can be free of charge or obtained by a fee.  

The FSF defines four specific software freedoms: 

* Freedom 0: use the software for any purpose 

* Freedom 1: examine the source code and modify it as you see fit 

* Freedom 2: redistribute the software 

* Freedom 3: redistribute your modified software 

## 9.  What is virtualization?

Virtualization is defined as creating virtual versions of something.
